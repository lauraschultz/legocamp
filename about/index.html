<h1>About Lego League Camp</h1>
<p style="text-indent: 1em; text-align: justify;">In 2014, a group of members from Great River School's robotics team, <a href="http://2491nomythic.com" target="_blank">No Mythic</a>, decided to create a camp for elementary school students that focused on building skills engineering skills. We wanted to get kids excited about science and technology, and what better way to do so than with robots? Lego League Camp is a summer day camp for kids going into 5<sup>th</sup> through 8<sup>th</sup> grade.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1em; margin-top: -8px; text-align: justify;">We have no paid employees here at camp! All the counselors are high school students who are volunteering their time to share their love of STEM and raise money for their robotics team. Every penny earned goes towards Robotics, Lego League and all the other amazing FIRST programs at Great River School. The camp fee is $200, but there is an option to apply for a scholarship on the <a href="/sign-up">sign up form.</a></p>
<h2>What is FIRST Lego League?</h2>
<p style="text-indent: 1em; text-align: justify; margin-top: -8px;">FIRST stands for "For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology". FIRST is an organization dedicated to getting young people engaged in STEM, with the mission of showing students of every age that science, technology, and problem-solving are not only fun and rewarding, but are proven paths to successful careers and a bright future for us all.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1em; margin-top: -8px; text-align: justify;">FIRST runs Lego League, a program that introduces younger students to real-world engineering challenges by building LEGO-based robots to complete tasks on a thematic playing surface. FLL teams, guided by their imaginations and adult coaches, discover exciting career possibilities and, through the process, learn to make positive contributions to society. <a href="http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/fll" target="_blank">Learn more about Lego League.</a></p>
<p style="text-indent: 1em; margin-top: -8px; text-align: justify;">Great River runs four Lego League teams during the school year, and Lego League campers are welcome and encouraged to join! More information will be sent out to camp participants at the start of the school year.</p>
<h2>What's a Typical Day At Camp Like?</h2>
<p style="text-indent: 1em; text-align: justify; margin-top: -8px; margin-bottom: 20px;">On the first day of camp, students are split up into groups of 3-4 and they spend the week building robots to complete a challenge that is given to them at the beginning of the day. The challenge might be to build the fastest robot, or to build a robot that can follow a line drawn on the ground. Students work with high school mentors to find unique solutions to the tasks, and at the end of the day campers demonstrate their robots to the rest of the group. No prior experience is necessary!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1em; margin-top: -8px; text-align: justify;">Each camp runs 9 AM until noon, Monday through Friday. Campers have the option of staying for lunch until 12:30. Lunch will not be provided, however, snack will be served each day.</p>
