<h1>Physical Toolkit</h1>
<p>Our 'camp-in-a-box' tooklit is available to rent for $400 a week. We include all the physical components you should need to run camp.</p>
<p>For many teams the cost of buying everything necessary to run a camp is too high to benefit financially from camp.  To make it easier for teams to afford and benefit from camp, we offer a toolkit complete with everything needed for one week of camp.  <p>
<p>Here is the financial breakdown.  One week of camp with 16 campers paying $150.00 each renders $2400.00 income.  Unfortunately, that is not enough money to cover the computers, legos and extra parts needed for camp. Our toolkit costs only $400.00 to rent for a week of camp. The cost of the kit goes towards updating and replacing parts and paying our administrative director to be available for you.  This leaves your team with $2000.00 to pay for insurance, space and snacks.  The rest of the money can go directly to your team!</p>
<p>If your team decides to use our toolkit, we offer delivery, support and pickup of the kit.  We deliver the complete kit on the Saturday before camp starts.  At that point, the kit has already been inspected and tested so that it is ready to go.  Our camp administrative director is available in person when the kit is dropped off and via phone throughout the week if any problems arise.  After camp on Friday, the administrative director comes to collect the kit.  If there are any new damages to any components of the kit, your team will be held financially responsible.</p>
